# Javascript Playground ðŸŽ¨

This repository is my personal space to practice and experiment with **Javascript**.  
Itâ€™s not a finished project, but a learning ground to strengthen my foundation in web development.

<!-- ## Goals
- Learn and explore core HTML elements
- Practice using semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Experiment with text formatting, lists, tables, forms, and multimedia
- Understand developer-friendly tags like `<pre>` and `<code>`
- Build a solid base before moving into CSS and JavaScript -->

## Purpose
This repo acts as a **hands-on lab** â€” a place to test ideas, break things, and grow my understanding of the webâ€™s building blocks. ðŸš€
